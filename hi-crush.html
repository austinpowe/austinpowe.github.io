		<p>I&#8217;m from Portland, Oregon, and I like to collect things like sci-fi paperbacks with goofy covers, drafts of tweets I&#8217;ll probably never publish, and handwritten notes.</p>

		<p>I just finished a creative internship at <a href="http://www.wk.com/work/from/newyork">Wieden+Kennedy New York</a>. While I was there, I realized that I missed the coding I did in school, and I want to get back in the habit of building web projects.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m really interested in your Front-End Engineer Internship, so I created this site to show you what I can do.</p>

		<p>Here are a few of my recent projects:</p>

			<h2>Get Rodcla</h2>
		</a>
		<p>This is a site I built to host a typeface I designed last year called Rodcla. So far the .OTF file has gotten a few downloads and I didn&#8217;t even know my mom knew how to install a font on her laptop.</p>

			<h2>The Venture Dept</h2>
		</a>
		<p>When I launched my own small ad agency in 2013, we needed a website. Our developer was a genius with back-end dark arts but bad at front-end, so I designed and coded most of our brand&#8217;s site. I also created a site for a conference we held last spring called <a href="http://brunch.venturedept.com/" target="_blank">Brunch With Venture</a>.</p>

			<h2>Austin Powe dot com</h2>
		</a>
		<p>I didn&#8217;t want to pay Cargo Collective so that they could keep getting all weird about how I could interact with my own website, so I built something I liked better. This site houses all my freelance writing and illustration work.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m multi-disciplinary, which is why I like the size and focus of your team. I&#8217;m passionate about design, illustration, and copywriting, so I&#8217;m able to help out in those areas whenever the project needs a little extra love.</p>
