<h1>Some of it is just transcendental, some of it is just really dumb</h1>
<h2>An experience with The Magnetic Fields.</h2>

<p>
The first song I heard by The Magnetic Fields was &#34;The Book of Love.&#34; I found it through my dad, who&#39;d played the Peter Gabriel cover a few times during his one-man <em>So</em>-revival phase in my early teens. When I looked up the original song, I was surprised. Both versions are gorgeous, but the contrast between the two is astounding. One is fully orchestrated and lush (and might I say, heavy-handed?) and the other is sparse and personal. The cover says, &#34;look at this big huge love I have for you, it&#39;s here and inescapable and reasonable&#34; while the original takes your hand and leads you to the soft, quiet room in your house where there&#39;s an old nylon-stringed acoustic guitar, and tells you, &#34;this is something I made for you because I love you so goddamn much.&#34;</p>

<p>
I only listened to the Magnetic Fields version occasionally--I was in middle school, music didn&#39;t really mean that much to me yet. Beyond that, songs about love meant even less. It wasn&#39;t until mid-high school that I began listening to the song closer, in earnest. It hit me so hard that I wanted to buy the rest of the album, so I got on the internet and discovered that the whole album actually had sixty-nine songs on it. Of course, I assumed it was a compilation album--no one releases sixty-nine songs at once, right?</p>

<p>
Nope. <em>69 Love Songs</em> is actually just that--a three-disc album comprised of sixty-nine songs about love. Not only that, but a lot of the songs are from the point of view of Stephin Merritt, the openly gay songwriter for The Magnetic Fields. This means that many of the love songs are about two men! Men in love! I&#39;d never heard music that nonchalantly told stories about gay dudes in love, and as a closeted teen boy I was hooked. Songs like &#34;Papa Was a Rodeo&#34;* and &#34;When My Boy Walks Down the Street&#34; and &#34;Sweet-Lovin&#39; Man&#34; made me realize that being an out, gay man didn&#39;t have to be awful--it could be wonderful, and you could even write songs about it! (Maybe even sixty-nine of them at a time.)</p>

<p>
Those sixty-nine songs were such a sizable chunk of music that I didn&#39;t listen to another Magnetic Fields album for a couple years. By then, I was in my first year of college. I heard a song in a movie, and I recognized Merritt&#39;s (incredibly distinctive) baritone but not the song itself. I found the song, and what do you know: it was on another Magnetic Fields concept album. &#34;I Don&#39;t Believe You&#34; is a song from <em>i</em>, an album with songs that only start with the letter i.</p>

<p>
After devouring <em>i</em>, I moved on to <em>Distortion</em> and then <em>Realism</em> and then on to <em>Love at the Bottom of the Sea</em>, following the band&#39;s actual linear progression. What I learned was that Merritt might shift around in genre and subject, but his quirky lyrical style and sense of humor shines through every time. At first, I thought it was corny. Who writes a whole song called &#34;I&#39;d Go Anywhere With Hugh&#34; that depends solely on a Hugh/you faux-homophone? And a whole album that starts with the letter i?</p>

<p>
I eventually realized how important those little lyrical jokes are. I&#39;m the kind of guy who likes a good (bad?) pun, so the songs are funny to me. Obviously, the jokes are funny to Merritt, too. Over and over again, Merritt writes songs that he feels passionate about. He makes art on a personal level, and that makes it resonate with his audience.</p>

<p>
The songs aren&#39;t complex, they&#39;re just catchy and honest. They&#39;ve made me feel comfortable in my own skin and have taught me to make honest art, even if that art might get a little punny sometimes.</p>

*Small side-story: When I got my wisdom teeth taken out, my mother drove me home from the oral surgeon. After the surgery I was incredibly doped up on pain medicine, but my mother tells me that when we got to the car I plugged my iPod into the speaker system and turned on &#34;Papa Was a Rodeo&#34; on repeat. We stopped at the store to pick up maple bars, my favorite food, and I half-rambled about the song to my mother and half-napped the rest of the way home. She&#39;s a saint, that woman.</p>
