<h1>Why don&#39;t you come on over, Valerie?</h1>
<h2>Road trips and rarity in the age of Spotify</h2>

<p>
With my left arm across the backseat and my feet up on the stack of sleeping bags, I let my right hand snake out the few inches of open window and felt the hot Californian wind push my fingers apart. I only stopped to pass a Costco-sized bag of trail mix up to my best friend in the front seat, where she was navigating and another best friend was driving.
</p>

<p>
We were a long way from Oregon&#39;s drizzly spring that was slipping into summer. A few days of camping in Yosemite made us appreciate the gigantic impending shift in our lives&#8212;graduation was only a few months away, but for now we were halfway to Los Angeles on our last spring break.
</p>

<p>
The old Subaru that endured the 1800 mile road trip hadn&#39;t yet entered the current technological age, and therefore didn&#39;t feature an auxiliary cable. We road trippers weren&#39;t daunted and before the journey, each crafted mix CDs that would sustain us on our jaunt along the west coast.
</p>

<p>
More than the medium itself, the songs on a mix CD inherently evoke nostalgia. Grimes or CHVRCHES sound strange coming from a CD instead of your iPhone, and the latest EDM hit-of-the-week from Soundcloud just doesn&#39;t work without the surrounding blogosphere for context. Especially on a road trip, you&#39;ve got to fill those 80 minutes with tracks you know the rest of the car will love. (Top picks include hits from middle school dances, ironic(?) pop singles, and the deep cuts from your generation&#39;s rebellious phase in early high school.)
</p>

<p>
Somewhere between Fresno and Bakersfield, with my bare feet on the seat in front of me and my sunglasses reflecting advice from my main girl <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/424.Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem">Joan</a>, I heard a song that wouldn&#39;t get out of my head. Was it recent? Was it a throwback that I should have known? Who was this woman with this amazing voice and how come I felt like I&#39;d heard this song before?
</p>

<p>
When I asked the ladies in the front of the car who the song was by, both turned to me expecting some kind of dumb joke or sarcasm. Who doesn&#39;t know Amy Winehouse&#39;s most famous single, or at least her iconic rough-around-the-edges voice?
</p>

<p>
I didn&#39;t, somehow.
</p>

<p>
Of course, after entering the earworm never left. &#34;Valerie&#34; was stuck in my head for the rest of the vacation. I was hooked.
</p>

<p>
We returned to Oregon and only listened to the mix CDs on our quick trips around town to hit Trader Joe&#39;s and the movie theater. I stopped hearing Amy&#39;s raspy pleas in my life, so I tried to inject them back in by adding the song to my current Spotify playlist.
</p>

<p>
But guess what? That&#39;s the only Amy Winehouse song that&#39;s not in Spotify&#39;s catalogue of over 20 million tracks.
</p>

<p>
One cursory glance at Amy&#39;s artist profile confirmed everything: It&#39;s just not there. Probably because of some strange label legalities or the wishes of Amy&#39;s estate. I was upset, but it&#39;s just a song&#8212;there&#39;s always <a href="https://medium.com/surrounded-by-the-sound">something else</a> to listen to.
</p>

<p>
Since that road trip, the only times I&#39;ve heard anyone implore me to &#34;stop making a fool out of them&#34; have been been the times when I&#39;ve least expected it.
</p>

<p>
Every time, it takes me a few seconds to remember how I know that rolling brass line, how I can anticipate when the snare drums will propel the beat into a finger-wagging sass-fest.
</p>

<p>
The song will float by as I&#39;m sitting in a coffee shop or when I&#39;m in the car with a friend and the radio is playing. It&#39;s always somewhere public, out of that private headphone-laptop-iPhone loop. That&#39;s what makes it so special: this is a song that I have developed memories around solely based on my experiences with it playing while I&#39;m with friends and family.
</p>

<p>
It&#39;s the hysterical blur of a late night at a dive bar, it&#39;s the &#34;welcome to Sunday morning&#34; coffee shop wake-up, it&#39;s the wind blowing down through the sun roof to gently tug at my hat while I count honest-to-god palm trees as we pass them on the highway, one-two-three-four-five-six-seven-eight.
</p>

<p>
After a little research, I&#39;ve learned that &#34;Valerie&#34; actually appears on Mark Ronson&#39;s 2007 album, <em>Version</em>. Although it is arguably one of Amy&#39;s iconic singles, it&#39;s not technically hers. Mark Ronson&#39;s version (from <em>Version</em>) does appear on Spotify. If I wanted to, I could add it to any mundane playlist I wanted.
</p>

<p>
But I won&#39;t.
